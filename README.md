Monday: Monday was the first day of my time with Red Hat. In my experience I found it to be a day where a lot of the focus was put on familiarizing all the people there with each other. 
This was achieved with a fun game. Later all the TYs got put into randomly selected groups and we were tasked to work together on a project involving building a potato head whilst keeping our shareholders happy.
I believe this is a good thing since knowing more about the people there made it less awkward.
The TYs also got a lovely tour of the Red Hat office. I thought the office looked really cool.

Tuesday: On Tuesday I attended a git workshop which helped me understand the basics of how to use git. 
I enjoyed this even though I had never experienced something like this before. Later on we played around with microbits.
We got a lot of freedom from our interns allowing us to programme the microbits in any we wanted which was nice.
However I still didnâ€™t enjoy working with the microbits.
I also like that we are given a lot of breaks to hang around the office. 
The pool table and consoles are a fun thing to do during the breaks.

Wednesday:  On Wednesday we were split into groups. 
Then within our groups we were tasked with building a roller coaster made out of straws and masking tape. 
Instead of a cart we were given a small ball to roll down the tracks. 
There was a requirement of at least one loop within the track. 
My group found this challenging. 
Later our interns gave us a talk on AI. 
I found it really interesting. Later the interns also talked to us about their college experiences. I found this insightful. Everyone here is very friendly .

Thursday:  On Thursday morning we attended a town hall meeting. This meeting consisted of Red Hat employees talking about Red Hat related subjects. 
Us TYs were tasked with introducing ourselves and giving a fun fact about ourselves.  
After the meeting Red Hat served a delicious breakfast. 
The eggs, bacon and sausages were lovely. 
I thought the hashbrowns were a bit dodgy. 
Nevertheless I enjoyed taking a break and eating breakfast with the lads. After breakfast we were given free time to play pool or play on the consoles.

Friday: On Friday us TYs got put into pairs and we were challenged to make a cart function with the help of microbits. I was in charge of making the code for the controller while my teammate coded his microbit for the cart. We also got pizza for lunch which was amazing. After lunch it was time to race our carts on an awesome track. I lost in the first round but it was fun while it lasted.
